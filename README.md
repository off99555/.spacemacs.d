My `.spacemacs.d` directory for [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)
configurations

# What is [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) ?
**Spacemacs** is an **Emacs** configuration distribution that makes **Emacs**
behave a lot like **Vim** by using model text editing and also provides many
useful features out of the box.

It forces heavy usage of **space** bar, thus the name **Spacemacs**. It refers
to the space bar as `SPC`.

# Screenshots
These are screenshots taken over time. The most recent one is at the bottom.

My current theme is **material** (I switched back from **majapahit-dark**).

This is a Spacemacs instance on Windows with **material** theme showing **which
key** buffer that is invoked by pressing `SPC`.

2. Clone this repository inside your home.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/off99555/.spacemacs.d.git

  It's a file automatically generated by Spacemacs.

4. That's it!

  You are now ready to use Spacemacs with my configuration.

# Configurations
Edit `~/.spacemacs.d/init.el` instead of `~/.spacemacs`.

You can open the configuration file directly via `SPC f e d`.

You can also compare the differences betweeh the default Spacemacs settings
versus mine via `SPC f e D`.
